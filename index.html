            <p>On September 5, 2020, the Project SEKAI Colorful Stage! Rehearsal Edit was released; it showcased the rhythm game itself, along with the Virtual Live room, where players were able to interact with one another. The Rehearsal Edit featured three songs; Hibana -Reloaded-, Sweet Magic, and Tell Your World, each having all five levels of beatmap difficulty. The demo ended on September 11th, 2020, and has not been playable since then. The game was released on September 30, 2020. Pre-registration was originally set to begin in late April but was delayed until further notice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the fifth Project SEKAI livestream, it was announced pre-registration will start on July 22. Because various preregistration milestones were reached, there would be rewards for everyone who downloaded the game from then on.</p>

These "overseas versions" would later result in the release four different localised versions of Project SEKAI, making the game accessible to international players in Chinese, English and Korean.</p>
