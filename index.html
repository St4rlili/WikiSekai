                    <h3>Initial Release</h3>
                    <p>On September 5, 2020, the <a href="" class="pi">Project SEKAI Colorful Stage! Rehearsal Edit</a> was released; it showcased the rhythm game itself, along with the Virtual Live room, where players were able to interact with one another. The Rehearsal Edit featured three songs; <a href="" class="pi">Hibana -Reloaded-</a>, <a href="" class="pi">Sweet Magic</a>, and <a href="" class="pi">Tell Your World</a>, each having all five levels of beatmap difficulty. The demo ended on September 11th, 2020, and has not been playable since then. The game was released on September 30, 2020. Pre-registration was originally set to begin in late April but was delayed until further notice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the fifth Project SEKAI livestream, it was announced pre-registration will start on July 22. Because various preregistration milestones were reached, there would be rewards for everyone who downloaded the game from then on.</p>
                    <h3>International Release</h3>
                    <p>Prior to the Japanese release of Project SEKAI, a statement for "fans outside of Japan" was made on the game's Twitter account, confirming that there were no plans for a simultaneous worldwide release of the game. However, "overseas versions" of the game were teased, and international fans were told to "stay tuned". These "overseas versions" would later result in the release four different localised versions of Project SEKAI, making the game accessible to international players in Chinese, English and Korean.</p>

This included it's associated <a href="" class="pi">story</a>, <a href="" class="pi">gacha</a>, and cards. Though compensation for the event's cancellation were prepared in the form of in-game gifts and additional content, this decision proved controversial among players.

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <hr>
                <div class="content7">
                    <p>Project SEKAI includes multiple types of lives, the main two being <a href="" class="pi">Solo Lives</a> and <a href="" class="pi">Multi Lives</a>. To participate in a live, you will need to build a team using five cards of any of the 26 playable characters. A player's team cannot contain more than one card of a certain playable character except during Challenge Lives. There are four note types in game: flick notes, tap notes, hold notes, and trace notes.</p>
                    <h3>Solo Live</h3>
                    <p>In a Solo Live, you can choose any song along with the vocals for that song, whether if it's the VIRTUAL SINGER, SEKAI, or Another Vocal (also called "Cover") version.</p>
                    <h3>Multi Live</h3>
                    <p>In a Multi Live (also called "Co-Op Live"), there are two rooms available: the General Room, available to everyone, and the Pro Room, available to players with a talent of 150,000 or more. Pro Room lives receive more rewards than General Room ones. You can also make a private room and invite your friends to play with you, making the room private or public. The gameplay is the same as a Solo Live, except that the song is chosen randomly from the selections of all five players. You cannot replay or pause during a Multi Live.</p>
                    <h3>Cheerful Live</h3>
                    <p>Cheerful Live is a live type only available during Cheerful Carnival events. In this live, you compete against another team in a Multi Live, earning team points if your team gains a higher score than the opposing team. Like in Multi Lives, there are two rooms, General and Pro. Instead of each player choosing a song, and then one song being randomly picked from the pool of chosen songs, a random song from the game is chosen to play. You cannot replay or pause during a Cheerful Live.</p>
                    <h3>Rank Match</h3>
                    <p>In Rank Match, skilled players compete directly against another user to climb the ranks and receive rewards at the end of a season. There are currently only three seasons of Rank Match, as well as two Preseasons.</p>
                    <h3>Live Boosts</h3>
                    <p>Live Boosts are items that boost the rewards, EXP, and event points you obtain after a live. You can use up to 10 boosts per live during an event, and five outside of an event period.</p>
                    <h3>Difficulties</h3>
                    <p>There are six levels of difficulty:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Easy (5 - 9)</li>
                        <li>Normal (10 - 15)</li>
                        <li>Hard (15 - 24)</li>
                        <li>Expert (21 - 31)</li>
                        <li>Master (25 - 37)</li>
                        <li>Append (APD23 - APD38)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Easy, Normal, Hard, Expert and Append difficulties are unlocked by default upon obtaining a song. To unlock a song's Master difficulty, it must be completed on Expert difficulty with not more than seven GOODs, BADs, and MISSes altogether (e.g. 4 GOODs, 1 BAD, 2 MISSes, adding up to 7).</p>
                    <p>Originally, the NORMAL difficulty had a range of 10 - 14, but since Hatsune Miku no Shoushitsu's NORMAL and HARD difficulty was rerated during the first anniversary, it increased the range to 10 - 15.</p>
                    <p>HARD difficulty originally had a range of 15 - 20, but for the same reasons as above, it was increased to 15 - 21. Later on, v2.0.0 would increase the difficulty expansion, adding levels 22 and 23. The release of Jouou would further expand the difficulty range to 15 - 24.</p>
                    <p>EXPERT difficulty originally had a range of 22 - 29. MACHINEGUN POEM DOLL's release would expand that range a bit more, introducing EXPERT level 30. Later on, v2.0.0's rerates would further expand that to 22 - 31. Then, Order Made would be the first level to have EXPERT level 21, which expands the range to what we have today.</p>
                    <p>MASTER difficulty originally had a range of 26 - 33. With the Gekichumai collaboration songs being added, level 34 was first introduced to that range. A few months later, v2.0.0 rerates would further expand the MASTER difficulty, introducing levels 35 and 36. After that, the first ULTIMATE song released (being What's up? Pop!) with a MASTER level of 37, which introduced multi-finger playing. Later, 25-ji no Jounetsu would release with a level of 25, which expands the range to what we have today.</p>
                    <p>On September 30, 2023, Project SEKAI's third anniversary, Append was introduced as the sixth difficulty, with a range of 23 - 38, which features charts meant to be played with more than three fingers. The difficulty numbering of Append charts is different from the other five difficulties, so an APD prefix is used in-game. Currently, there are no charts with a difficulty level of APD23 or APD38.</p>
                    <p>Initially, 13 songs were selected to be added with an Append chart. Since the release of this difficulty level, at least one to three currently in-game songs have been selected to be added with an Append chart each month.</p>

                    <p>15 minutes before a live begins, the live room will open. The live will start at the hour displayed on the ticket in the Virtual Live menu. In the live room, you can send items, use emotes, change the color of your penlight, and perform actions. When the live has finished, you can leave and claim rewards from attending the live.</p>
